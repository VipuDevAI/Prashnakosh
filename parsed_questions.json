Basic terminologies: • TOKEN / LEXICAL UNIT: Smallest individual unit in a Programming Language. • Types of Tokens (Keywords, Identifiers, Literals, Operators, Punctuators) NOTE: Mnemonic: \" Kind Intelligent Lions Often Prey” • Keywords: Reserved words having special meaning. Literals True, False, None Operators not, and, or, is, in Empty statement Pass Conditional Statements if, elif, else Iterative statements for, while, break, continue Exception Handling try, except, finally, assert, raise Functions def, return, global File Handling with Others del, import, from, as, lambda, nonlocal, yield, class • Identifiers: These are the names given to variables, objects, classes or functions etc. Identifier Naming Rules: ✔ Python identifiers must begin with a letter (A-Z or a -z) or an underscore (_) ✔ It can be followed by letters, digits (0 -9), or underscores . TOKENS KEYWORDS IDENTIFIERS LITERALS OPERATORS PUNCTUATORS 4 | P a g e ✔ However, Python keywords cannot be used as Identifiers ✔ Special characters like @, #, or $ cannot be while naming Identifiers. ✔ Length of identifier is endless and is case sensitive. • Literals / Constants: Data items that have a fixed value are called Literals. Example: 5 (integer), 5.9 (float), True (Boolean) , “Hello” (string) • Operators: Symbols that trigger some action. Arithmetic Operators **, *, /, //, % Relational Operators <, <=, >, >=, ==, != Logical Operators not, and, or Identity Operator is, is not Membership Operator in, not in Assignment Operator =, +=, -=, *=, /=, //=, %= • Operator Precedence : Operator precedence defines the priority of operators in an expression. • Operator Associativity : It define the direction in which operators of same precedence are evaluated either from left to right or right to left. Precedence Level Operators Description Associativity 1 (Highest) ( ) Parentheses (grouping) N/A 2 x[index] , x[attr] , x(...) , x[...] Subscription, attribute reference, call Left to Right 3 ** Exponentiation Right to Left 4 +x, -x, ~x Unary plus, minus, bitwise NOT Right to Left 5 *, /, //, % Multiplication, division, floor division, modulo Left to Right 6 +, - Addition, subtraction Left to Right 7 <<, >> Bitwise shift operators Left to Right 8 & Bitwise AND Left to Right 9 ^ Bitwise XOR Left to Right 10 | Bitwise OR Left to Right 11 in, not in , is, is not , <, <=, >, >=, !=, == Comparisons, identity, membership tests Left to Right 12 Not Boolean NOT Right to Left 13 And Boolean AND Left to Right 14 Or Boolean OR Left to Right 15(Lowest) = Assignment operator Right to Left 5 | P a g e Example : Evaluate 100 + 200 / 10 - 3 * 10 Here, the operators /, * have similar precedence and +, - have same precedence, hence the expression will be evaluated as ((100 + (200 / 10)) – (3 * 10)), which equals to 90.0 • Punctuators : Symbols that are used to organize sentence structure. These are used to give syntactic and semantic meaning to the program statement. Some commonly used punctuators are: • Data Types in Python • Variables: Variables are containers for storing data values. Key points: ⮚ Variables do not need to be declared or defined in advance. ⮚ A variable is created when you first assign a value to it. ⮚ Python is dynamically typed language where data type of the variable is not required statically. ⮚ Example: # Initially assigning an integer value x = 88 # x assigned as integer type print (\"x =\", x, \" Type:\", type(x)) # Reassigning a string value to the same variable x = \"Dynamic Typing in Python\" # x assigned as string type print (\"x =\", x, \" Type:\", type(x)) ‘ “ # \\ ( ) [ ] { } @ , : . = ; 6 | P a g e Note: Dynamic typing allows user to assign different values to same variable at different places in a program • Conversion of Data Types in Python Type Promotion (Implicit Type Conversion) Type Casting (Explicit Type Conversion): Python interpreter automatically converts/ promotes one data type to another higher type without any user involvement The data type is manually changed by the user as per their requirement. With explicit type conversion, there is a risk of data loss since we are forcing an expression to be changed in some specific data type. Example: x = 100 y = 10.6 z = x + y print(z) print (\"z is of type:”, type(z)) # z is implicitly converted to floating type Example: a, b= 5.88, ‘4’ c=int(a) print( “c=”,c) # c=5 d=int(b) print(“d=”,d) #d=4 Python Modules: • A module is a file containing Python code (functions, variables, classes) that can be imported and used in other Python programs. • Modules help organize code and reuse functionality. Random Number generation random Module: The random module in Python is a powerful tool for generating random numbers and performing random operations. • To use the random module, you must import it first : import random • It provides several functions to produce random values, simulate randomness, and shuffle data. Name of method Method Description Example Random Float random ( ) Generate a random float number between 0.0 and 1.0. import random random. random ( ) Random Integer randint ( ) Generate a random integer within a specified range (both values inclusive) import random random. randint (1, 10) Random Range randrange ( ) Generate a random number within a specified range with a step. import random random. randrange (0, 100, 5) # Random number between 0 and 100, step 5 STRING • A string is a sequence of characters enclosed in single (' ') , double (\" \") , or triple (''' ''' / \"\"\" \"\"\") quotes. • Strings are immutable — once created, they cannot be changed . 7 | P a g e • Strings are indexed , starting from 0 (left to right) and -1 (right to left). • Use triple quotes (''' ''' or \"\"\" \"\"\") for multiline text . • Use \\ to include special characters (e.g., \\n for newline, \\t for tab). LIST • A list is a collection of items (elements) which are ordered. • Lists are mutable, meaning their contents can be changed after creation. • Lists can contain elements of different data types: integers, strings, floats, even other lists. • Lists are indexed, with the first element at index 0. • Defined using square brackets []. • Example: • my_list = [10, \"Hello\", 3.14, True] TUPLE • Ordered – Elements are stored in a specific order. • Immutable – Once created, elements cannot be changed. • Allow duplicates – Tuples can contain repeated values. • Can hold different data types – Integers, strings, lists, etc. • Indexing – Elements can be accessed using indexes. • Faster than lists – Due to immutability. • Tuples written in parenthesis ( ). Multiple element tuple Single element tuple t=(10,20,30) tup = 10, 20, 30 t = (10,) # Comma is important Note: t=10 #t is integer • Packing Unpacking of Tuple tup = 10, 20, 30 a, b, c = tup print(a ,b,c) # 10 20 30 DICTIONARY • A dictionary in Python is an unordered collection of items. • Each item is a key-value pair . • Dictionaries are mutable (can be changed). • Defined using curly braces {} with key:value pairs. • Key : Must be unique and immutable (string, number, tuple) • Value : Can be any datatype and can be duplicate • Keys are used to access values. 8 | P a g e Data type Operations Traversal Concatenatio n (+) Replication (*) Membership (in, not in) Slicing (start :stop :step ) String ‘Hello’ Traversing using a for loop for char in s: print(char) Traversing using indexing for i in range(len(s)): print(s[i]) \"Hello\" + \" World!\" \"Hello World!\" \"Hello\" *2 \"Hello Hello” \"W\" in \"World!\" True “P\" not in \"Hello World!\" False (a) s[start:end] \"Hello\"[1:4] \"ell\" (b) s [: end] \"Hello\"[:3] \"Hel\" (c) s[start:] \"Hello\"[2:] “Hel” (d) s[start:end:step] \"Hello\"[::2] \"Hlo\" List [1,2,3] lst=[10,20,30,40] for i in lst: print(i) for i in range(len(lst)): print(lst[i]) [1,2] + [3,4] [1,2,3,4] [0] * 3 [0,0,0] 3 in [1, 2, 3] True L=[11,12,14,17] L[1:3] [12,14] L[:3] [11,12,14] Tuple (1,2,3) tpl=(10,20,30,40) for i in tpl: print(i) for i in range(len(tpl)): print(tpl [i]) (1,2) + (3,4) (1,2,3,4) (1) * 3 (1,1,1) 3 in (1, 2, 3) True L=(11,12,14,17) L(1:3) (12,14) L(:3) (11,12,14) String Functions and Methods Method Explanation Example Output len( ) Returns number of characters in",

Exceptions interrupt the normal flow of a program. Common examples of exceptions: • Dividing by zero (ZeroDivisionError) • Accessing a missing file (FileNotFoundError) • Using an undefined variable (NameError) Without handling exceptions , a program crashes when an error occurs. Need for Exception Handling • Prevents program from crashing abruptly. • Helps in providing user -friendly error messages . • Ensures smooth program execution even after an error. Handling Exceptions using try -except -finally Blocks Python provides a structured way to handle exceptions using three keywords: Keyword Purpose try Used to write code that may cause an exception. except Used to catch and handle the exception. finally Used to execute code whether an exception occurs or not (cleanup code). try: # Code that might raise an exception except ExceptionType: # Code that runs if the exception occurs finally: # Code that will run no matter what (optional) try block → Python runs the code inside try. If an exception occurs : The try block is exited immediately. The control moves to the except block . finally block always runs after the try/except.

    "questionText": "Binary Files • Store data in binary (0s and 1s). • Not human -readable. • Extensions: .exe, .jpg, .dat • Used for images, audio, video, and compiled programs. NOTE: A text file can be understood as a sequence of characters consisting of alphabets, numbers and other special symbols. Files with extensions like .txt, .py, .csv, etc. are some examples of text files. 31 | P a g e ✔ While opening a text file, the text editor translates each ASCII value and shows us the equivalent character that is readable by the human being. ✔ Each line of a text file is terminated by a special character, called the End of Line (EOL). For example, the default EOL character in Python is the newline ( \\n). Steps to Process Text Files: To open a file in Python, we use the open ( ) function. The syntax of open ( ) is as follows: file_object= open (file_name, access_mode) ex1. Fobj= open('abc.txt,'w') ex2. Fobj= open('D: \\\\Computer \\\\abc.txt’, 'w') #double slash should be used in file path ex3. Fobj= open(r'D: \\Computer \\abc.txt, 'w') #if you don’t want to use // then use r in front of file Note: if file mode is not mentioned in open function, then default file mode, 'r' is used File Open Modes File Mode Description File Offset position <r> Opens the file in read -only mode. Beginning of the file <rb> Opens the file in binary and read -only mode. Beginning of the file <r+> Opens the file in both read and write mode. Beginning of the file <w> Opens the file in write mode. If the file already exists, all the contents will be overwritten. If the file doesn’t exist, then a new file will be created. Beginning of the file <wb> Opens the file in binary and write mode. If the file already exists, all the contents will be overwritten. If the file doesn’t exist, then a new file will be created. Beginning of the file <wb+> Opens the file in read, write and binary mode. If the file already exists, the contents will be overwritten. If the file doesn’t exist, then a new file will be created. Beginning of the file <a> Opens the file in append mode. If the file doesn’t exist, then a new file will be created. End of the file <a+> Opens the file in append and read mode. If the file doesn’t exist, then it will create a new file. End of the file Use of With Clause Syntax: with open (“file name”, access mode) as file object: example: with open(“book.txt”, ’r’) as f: NOTE: No need to close the file explicitly if we are using with clause 32 | P a g e Closing a file • Once done with the read/write operations on a file, close the file. • Python provides a close ( ) method to do so. • While closing a file, the system frees the memory allocated to it. • The syntax of close ( ) is: file_object.close ( ) Writing to a Text File • For writing to a file, open it in write or append mode. • If we open an existing file in write mode, the previous data will be erased, and the file object will be positioned at the beginning of the file. • On the other hand, in append mode, new data will be added at the end of the previous data as the file object is at the end of the file. • After opening the file, we can use the following methods to write data in the file. • write ( ) - for writing a single string • writelines ( ) - for writing a sequence of strings Example 1: with open (\"sample.txt\", \"w\") as f: f.write (\"Hello World \\n\") f.write (\"This is a second line. \\n\") #You need to manually add \\n if you want line breaks. Example 2: lines = [\"Line 1 \\n\", \"Line 2 \\n\", \"Line 3 \\n\"] with open (\"sample_lines.txt\", \"w\") as f: f.writelines (lines) #It does not add newlines automatically – include \\n in each string if needed. Reading from a Text File • Before reading a file, we must make sure that the file is opened in “r”, “r+”, “w+” or “a+” mode. • There are three ways to read the contents of a file: read ( ) readline ( ) readlines ( ) Reads the entire file as one string Reads one line at a time Reads all lines into a list of strings Use when you want to load the whole file at once Call multiple times to read multiple lines useful for looping through lines f.read ( ) Output \"Hello \\nWorld \\nPython\" f.readline ( ) Output \"Hello \\n\" f.readlines ( ) Output [\"Hello \\n\",\"World \\n\", Python\"] to read a specified number of bytes use f.read(n) used to read a specified number (n) of bytes of data from a file but maximum up to the newline character (\\n) f.readline(n) using readlines ( ) function, lines in the file become members of a list, where each list element ends with a newline character (‘ \\n’) 33 | P a g e SETTING OFFSETS IN A FILE • The tell ( ) method • The seek ( ) method This function returns an integer that specifies the current position of the file object in the file. This method is used to position the file object at a particular position in a file. The position specified is the byte position from the beginning of the file till the current position of the file object. In the given syntax, offset is the number of bytes by which the file object is to be moved. reference_point indicates the starting position of the file object. That is, with reference to which position, the offset has to be counted. It can have any of the following values: 0 - beginning of the file 1 - current position of the file 2 - end of file The syntax of using tell ( ) is: file_object.tell ( ) The syntax of seek ( ) is: file_object.seek(offset [, reference_point]) RELATIVE AND ABSOLUTE PATH Absolute Path: • It gives the complete path to a file or folder from the root directory. • Always starts from the drive name (Windows) or root “/” (Linux/Mac). • Used when the exact location of the file is known. Example: f = open (\"C:/Users/John/Documents/data.txt\", \"r\") Relative Path: • It gives the location relative to the current working directory (where your Python script is). • Useful for portability across systems. Example: f = open (\"files/data.txt\", \"r\") Special Notations: . → Current directory .. → Parent directory # Access file in parent directory f = open (\"../data.txt\", \"r\") #To get current working directory import os print(os.getcwd ( )) Multiple Choice Questions",

Steps to process a binary file • Opening a file • Writing data into a file • Reading data from a file • Closing a file Opening a Binary file in Python Opening a file refers to getting the file ready either for reading or for writing.

Answers : 1 C 2 C 3 A 4 D 5 C Short Answer Type Questions: 1 What is the purpose of the pickle module in Python? 2 State two advantages of using binary files over text files in Python. 3 How many times should pickle.load ( ) be called while reading a binary file? Explain your answer with reference to the number of times pickle.dump ( ) was used while writing the file. Answers : 1 The pickle module is used for serializing and de -serializing Python objects into binary format. It allows saving complex data types like dictionaries, lists, etc., into a binary file and retrieving them later. 2 Binary files can store complex Python objects (like dictionaries, lists) directly. They are more secure and efficient in terms of storage space and speed. 3 The number of times pickle.load ( ) should be called is equal to the number of times pickle.dump ( ) was called when the file was written. If the file was written using pickle.dump ( ) 3 times, then you must call pickle.load ( ) 3 times to read all the data. Since we may not know the exact count, load ( ) is usually called inside a loop until EOFError occurs. Long Answer Type Questions:",

Client : It is a computer capable of requesting, receiving & displaying information in the form of web pages or using a particular service from the service providers (Servers). 78 | P a g e Servers : It is a remote computer which provides/transfers information to the client (in the form of web pages) or access to particular services. Difference between Internet and WWW Internet World Wide Web(WWW) Internet stands for Interconnected Networks WWW stands for World wide Web Internet is a means of connecting a computer to any other computer anywhere in the world. World Wide Web which is a collection of information which is accessed via the Internet. Internet is infrastructure. WWW is service on top of that infrastructure. Internet is primarily hardware -based WWW is more software -oriented as compared to the Internet. Internet uses TCP/IP protocol. WWW uses HTTP Protocol. HTML (Hypertext Mark -up Language): It is a mark -up language that tells web browsers how to structure the web pages you visit. It has a variety of tags and attributes for defining the layout and structure of the web document. A HTML document has the extension .htm or .html. Hypertext is a t ext which is linked to another html document via clickable links known as hyperlinks. XML (eXtensible Mark -up Language) : XML is a mark -up language like HTML but it is designed to transport or store data. It does not have predefined tags but allows the programmer to use customized tags. An XML document has the extension .xml. HTML v/s XML HTML XML HTML stands for Hyper Text Mark -up Language XML stands for eXtensible Mark -up Language HTML is a case insensitive. XML is case sensitive. Predefined tags (commands). User defined tags (commands). It is used for presentation of the Data. It is used for transportation of the Data. Small errors can be ignored. Errors not allowed. Closing tags are optional. Compulsory to use closing tags. HTTP - Hyper Text Transfer Protocol : HTTP is used to transfer data across the web. HTTP specifies how to transfer hypertext (linked web documents) between two computers. It allows users of the World Wide Web to exchange information found on web pages. Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is an extension of the HTTP which is used for secure communication over a computer network. Domain Names : Every device connected to the Internet has a numeric IP address which is very difficult to remember. Each computer server hosting a website or web resource is given a name known as Domain Name corresponding to unique IP addresses. For example, IP address es and domain names of some websites are as follows: Domain Name IP Address ncert.nic.in 164.100.60.233 cbse.nic.in 164.100.107.32 79 | P a g e The process of converting a hostname (such as www.google.com) into the corresponding IP address (such as 172.217.14.196) is called domain name resolution. Specialized DNS servers are used for domain name resolution (DNS resolution). URL -Uniform Resource Locator : Every web page that is displayed on the Internet has a specific address associated with it, this address is known as the URL. The structure of a URL can be represented as follows: http://www.example.com/planet/earth/river.jpg Protocol Domain name foldername filename The URL consists of four basic parts, namely, protocol, hostname, folder name and the filename.

The speed of these devices may be different. Also, the data transfer rates of different networks may be different. These complexities make it necessary to have a common set of rules i.e., Pr otocols to ensure the secure communication of data 5 Internet means interconnected networks that spread all over the world (i.e. the physical infrastructure), while WWW means the information’s (available in the form of webpages) that can be accessed through internet. 6 Protocols are set of rules that are followed while transmitting data through a computer network. Protocols determines how to data can be moved securely from a source device to a destination device. The protocol used for transferring a file from one device to another is the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) 7 In order to chat, you need to have an account on the same service as the person you are chatting with. e.g. on the other hand, in case of E -mail, it is not necessary, i.e. you can have an account from any provider and you can establish your own. 8 Cookies are files stored temporarily on www browser’s computer, which allow the www server to store persistent information associated with browsing user on user’s system 9 IP addresses look like this: 192.168.12.134. Domain names look like this: “www.google.com” Domain names are easier for us to remember and use, while computers are quite handy with numbers. Thus, we use DNS (Domain Naming System) to translate domain names into the IP addresses. IP address is a unique identifier for a computer or device on internet.

    "questionText": "If you are adding values for all the columns of the table, you do not need to specify the column names in the SQL query. However, make sure the order of the values is in the same order as the columns in the table. Here, the INSERT INTO syntax would be a s follows: INSERT INTO table_name VALUES ( value1 , value2 , value3 , ...); DELETE: The DELETE statement is used to delete existing records in a table. DELETE Syntax: DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition ; Note: Be careful when deleting records in a table! Notice the WHERE clause in the DELETE statement. The WHERE clause specifies which record(s) should be deleted. If you omit the WHERE clause, all records in the table will be deleted! The following SQL statement deletes all rows in the \"Customers\" table, without deleting the table: DELETE FROM Customers; UPDATE The UPDATE statement is used to modify the existing records in a table. UPDATE Syntax: UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1 , column2 = value2 , ... WHERE condition ; UPDATE Table 93 | P a g e The following SQL statement updates the first customer (CustomerID = 1) with a new contact person and a new city. UPDATE Customers SET ContactName = 'Alfred Schmidt', City= 'Frankfurt' WHERE CustomerID = 1; SELECT The SELECT statement is used to select data from a database. The data returned is stored in a result table, called the result -set. SELECT Syntax: SELECT column1 , column2, ... FROM table_name ; Here, column1, column2, ... are the field names of the table you want to select data from. If you want to select all the fields available in the table, use the following syntax: SELECT * FROM table_name ; WHERE Clause: The WHERE clause is used to filter records. It is used to extract only those records that fulfill a specified condition. WHERE Syntax: SELECT column1 , column2, ... FROM table_name WHERE condition ; Operators in The WHERE Cla use The following operators can be used in the WHERE clause: Operator Description = Equal > Greater than < Less than >= Greater than or equal <= Less than or equal <> Not equal. Note: In some versions of SQL this operator may be written as != BETWEEN Between a certain range LIKE Search for a pattern IN To specify multiple possible values for a column AND, OR and NOT Operators The WHERE clause can be combined with AND, OR, and NOT operators. The AND and OR operators are used to filter records based on more than one condition: • The AND operator displays a record if all the conditions separated by AND are TRUE. • The OR operator displays a record if any of the conditions separated by OR is TRUE. • The NOT operator displays a record if the condition(s) is NOT TRUE. AND Syntax SELECT column1 , column2, ... FROM table_name WHERE condition1 AND condition2 AND condition3 ... ; OR Syntax SELECT column1 , column2, ... FROM table_name WHERE condition1 OR condition2 OR condition3 ... ; NOT Syntax SELECT column1 , column2, ... 94 | P a g e FROM table_name WHERE NOT condition ; IN Operator The IN operator allows you to specify multiple values in a WHERE clause. The IN operator is a shorthand for multiple OR conditions. IN Syntax SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name WHERE column_name IN (value1 , value2 , ...); BETWEEN Operator The BETWEEN operator selects values within a given range. The values can be numbers, text, or dates. The BETWEEN operator is inclusive: begin and end values are included. BETWEEN Syntax SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name WHERE column_name BETWEEN value1 AND value2; LIKE Operator The LIKE operator is used in a WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column. There are two wildcards often used in conjunction with the LIKE operator: • The percent sign (%) represents zero, one, or multiple characters • The underscore sign (_) represents one, single character The percent sign and the underscore can also be used in combinations! LIKE Syntax SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name WHERE columnN LIKE pattern ; LIKE Operator Description WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a%' Finds any values that start with \"a\" WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%a' Finds any values that end with \"a\" WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%or%' Finds any values that have \"or\" in any position WHERE CustomerName LIKE '_r%' Finds any values that have \"r\" in the second position WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a_%' Finds any values that start with \"a\" and are at least 2 characters in length WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a__%' Finds any values that start with \"a\" and are at least 3 characters in length WHERE ContactName LIKE 'a%o' Finds any values that start with \"a\" and ends with \"o\" SQL Aliases SQL aliases are used to give a table, or a column in a table, a temporary name. Aliases are often used to make column names more readable. An alias only exists for the duration of that query. An alias is created with the AS keyword. Alias Column Syntax: SELECT column_name AS alias_name FROM table_name; 95 | P a g e Alias Table Syntax: SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name AS alias_name; DISTINCT The SELECT DISTINCT statement is used to return only distinct (different) values. Inside a table, a column often contains many duplicate values; and sometimes you only want to list the different (distinct) values. SELECT DISTINCT Syntax: SELECT DISTINCT column1 , column2, ... FROM table_name ; SELECT Example Without DISTINCT The following SQL statement selects all (including the duplicates) values from the \"Country\" column in the \"Customers\" table: Eg: SELECT Country FROM Customers; Now, let us use the SELECT DISTINCT statement and see the result. SELECT DISTINCT Examples The following SQL statement selects only the DISTINCT values from the \"Country\" column in the \"Customers\" table: SELECT DISTINCT Country FROM Customers; The following SQL statement lists the number of different (distinct) customer countries: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Country) FROM Customers; NULL value",
